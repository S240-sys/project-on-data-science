In this small project i have done data vizualization and statistical modelling in python. 
This is a simple python based code which had worked on a HotelReservation dataset to analyse the pattern of of hotel booking, rooms available, peek seasons, frequency of incomming guest etc.
I have been provided with the data set on which i had worked by my college authourity.
